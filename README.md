# ObjectOrientedCalculator
Watch me learn Java by putting theory &amp; knowledge in practice  

With this project I wanted to get familiar with Java and its characteristics.  
Thus I made a simple calculator which respects the **MVC-Pattern** as well as an **Object-Oriented** approach.  

Note:  
- The implementation of views is not that serious and deeply thought-out, because this project is a simple console app, yet they exist.
- Simple exception handling within the userinterface's input-methods exist, yet further exception handling is not meant to be considered.
- This app will not be further developed, due the project only being there for me to get in touch with Java, not to get a stable product on the market.
